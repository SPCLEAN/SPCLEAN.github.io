I'm a second-year Ph.D. student from [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) and I work with Professor Hao Wu as a member of the THMIL lab. I currently also am the technical research engineer (intern) at [Huawei Technologies Company](https://www.huawei.com/). My research interest includes numerical computation for optimization like optimal transport, statistics for finance and machine learning. 

I recieved my Bachelor of Engineering from Tsien Excellence in Engineering Program, [School of Aerospace Engineering](https://www.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) and also minored in Statistics at [Center for Statistical Science](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).
